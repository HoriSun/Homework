## How to use

__This script is a stupid tool to check your homework__

1. Name the files correctlly as our requirement, then put them in this directory.
2. Run shell script

```bash
$chmod +x check_homework.sh
$./check_homework.sh
```
The `chmod` is used to make sure the script file have the permission to execute.

3. If everything work as expected, you can get the file like
   `id_name.cpp.result`.
